    Task 02-04

    The support of a string x in the list of strings xs is the number of strings 
    in xs where x is a substring.
    Given a list of strings xs, and integer k, find  k such two-character strings 
    that have the biggest support in xs (there can be many equal answers). 
    Return the answer as a list of (support,string) pairs.
    E.g. if xs = ["hello","there","all"] and k = 3, 
    then one possible answer is [(2,"ll"),(2,"he"),(1,"th")]

-- Tähän jäätiin, eli yritä hakea jokainen x pitkä subs sanasta
-- "hello"- > he, el, ll, lo (josta sitten lasketaan esiintymät kaikista!)
-- example: getsubs "kissa" 0 2 -> ["ki","is","ss","sa"]

{- 
    Gets a substring.

{- 
    Returns Int how many substrs was found from a list of words.
    Example input: ["hello","there","all"], "ll":
    gets num. of occurences from 1. word (see func. subs), calls recursively itself
    for rest of the words
    Above example input:
    1 + 0 + 1 = 2

    Take string and substr and return number of substring occurences
